??? note "Question: Can Qodo Merge serve as a substitute for a human reviewer?"
    #### Answer:<span style="display:none;">1</span>

    Qodo Merge is designed to assist, not replace, human reviewers.

    Reviewing PRs is a tedious and time-consuming task often seen as a "chore". In addition, the longer the PR â€“ the shorter the relative feedback, since long PRs can overwhelm reviewers, both in terms of technical difficulty, and the actual review time.
    Qodo Merge aims to address these pain points, and to assist and empower both the PR author and reviewer.

    However, Qodo Merge has built-in safeguards to ensure the developer remains in the driver's seat. For example:

    1. Preserves user's original PR header
    2. Places user's description above the AI-generated PR description
    3. Cannot approve PRs; approval remains reviewer's responsibility
    4. The code suggestions are optional, and aim to:
        - Encourage self-review and self-reflection
        - Highlight potential bugs or oversights
        - Enhance code quality and promote best practices

??? note "Question: I received an incorrect or irrelevant suggestion. Why?"

    #### Answer:<span style="display:none;">2</span>

    - Modern AI models, like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4, are improving rapidly but remain imperfect. Users should critically evaluate all suggestions rather than accepting them automatically.
    - AI errors are rare, but possible. A main value from reviewing the code suggestions lies in their high probability of catching **mistakes or bugs made by the PR author**. We believe it's worth spending 30-60 seconds reviewing suggestions, even if some aren't relevant, as this practice can enhances code quality and prevent bugs in production.


    - The hierarchical structure of the suggestions is designed to help the user to _quickly_ understand them, and to decide which ones are relevant and which are not:

        - Only if the `Category` header is relevant, the user should move to the summarized suggestion description.
        - Only if the summarized suggestion description is relevant, the user should click on the collapsible, to read the full suggestion description with a code preview example.

    - In addition, we recommend to use the [`extra_instructions`](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/tools/improve/#extra-instructions-and-best-practices) field to guide the model to suggestions that are more relevant to the specific needs of the project.
    - The interactive [PR chat](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/chrome-extension/) also provides an easy way to get more tailored suggestions and feedback from the AI model.
