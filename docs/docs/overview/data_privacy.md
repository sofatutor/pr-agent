## Self-hosted Qodo Merge

- If you self-host Qodo Merge with your OpenAI (or other LLM provider) API key, it is between you and the provider. We don't send your code data to Qodo Merge servers.

## Qodo Merge Pro ðŸ’Ž

- When using Qodo Merge Pro ðŸ’Ž, hosted by CodiumAI, we will not store any of your data, nor will we use it for training. You will also benefit from an OpenAI account with zero data retention.

- For certain clients, CodiumAI-hosted Qodo Merge Pro will use CodiumAIâ€™s proprietary models. If this is the case, you will be notified.

- No passive collection of Code and Pull Requestsâ€™ data â€” Qodo Merge will be active only when you invoke it, and it will then extract and analyze only data relevant to the executed command and queried pull request.


## Qodo Merge Chrome extension

- The [Qodo Merge Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pr-agent-chrome-extension/ephlnjeghhogofkifjloamocljapahnl) will not send your code to any external servers.
